      In the process of moving back to Australia I had to sell all the cruft I accumlated over the last year. Building on the static page I built in 2013 I wanted an easier way to sell of my stuff. I built a simple rails app integrated with Stripe making checkout easy for those interested.

      While teaching myself Python, data structures and algorithms, and to avoid forgetting this new found knowledge I created this web-app where I can test myself. For each discovery a memory card is created with a problem and solution, however the solution is only displayed once you've attempted to work it out yourself.

      In the process of moving to America I had a lot of cruft I needed to be rid of. I wanted an easy way to share an up-to-date list with friends, family and coworkers so I didn't have to repeat myself across various social channels. Made it somewhat responsive for the lawls
