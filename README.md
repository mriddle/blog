### Writing a post

Write your drafts under the `_drafts` folder with a filename like `2000-01-31-lol-wut.md`
When you're ready to publish a post move it into the `_posts` folder.

### Deployment

`git push`

Setup with just the `gh-pages` branch so anything you do in this branch will be displayed on the site on push. (It can take up to 10 minutes to be reflected)

### Development

`jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""`

Run the following line from within the project and make your changes.
Jekyll will automatically update as you updated the blog
