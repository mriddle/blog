title:  "Ding! Leveling up"

Had a riot this weekend. Squandered most of it in front of my laptop playing with Linux, Rails, Ruby, Heroku and GitHub while waiting for my domain name changes to take effect.

I have decided to start a blog for all my technological encounters (battles). I seem to solve a new problem every day, I believe it's worth while documenting them, hopefully helping someone else out in the process.

Big thanks to Chris Aitchison (http://www.chrisaitchison.com/) for putting me on this new and exciting path. This blog was built off Enki's blog (http://www.enkiblog.com/) check it out if you feel like forking up your own! It's neat and easy to use.

Back to tinkering!
