title:  "Resize pictures"
---

Thought I would take a moment to share a handy tool.

Microsoft has an awesome little utility (yeah I know) called Image Resizer it was originally a Powertoy designed for Windows XP but it's been ported to Windows 7 and Vista (32 and 64bit supported).

Find it <a href="http://imageresizer.codeplex.com/" alt="lol it's a link">here</a> .

Basically after the installation "Resize Pictures" will be added to your context menu. To resize pictures simply select a bunch right click > resize and select your size.

While we're on the subject of handy tools, check out TeraCopy, TextPad and foobar2000. Great apps I have installed on pretty much every machine I use.
