---

Hey peeps,

Sublime text 2 comes with the ability to remove trailing whitespace on save but is disabled by default.
To enable it simply open Sublime Preferences > Settings - User and change trim_trailing_white_space_on_save


    // Set to true to removing trailing white space on save
    "trim_trailing_white_space_on_save": true,


DEATH TO ALL WHITESPACE
