title:  "Adding the Reveal-in-sidebar shortcut to Sublime Text 2"
---

Most users are making the change from TextMate to Sublime, one of the cool shortcuts TextMate has is 'Reveal in Sidebar'

Sublime doesn't come with this out of the box but it's simple enough to add

Under Sublime Preferences > Key Bindings, add the following line

`{ "keys": ["super+ctrl+r"], "command": "reveal_in_side_bar"}`

Enjoy!
