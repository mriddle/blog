title:  "Awesome OSX window management"

Found a decent window management app that's free and [open source](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt) . It's called Shiftit and is a great alliterative to Divy, SizeUp, etc.

Although it hasn't been updated in a while it works fine on 10.7 Lion. Not sure about Mountain Lion, haven't tried.

[Download it here](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt/downloads)
