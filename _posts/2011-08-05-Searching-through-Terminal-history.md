title:  "Searching through Terminal history"
---

Hey Everyone,

Stumbled upon a neat tip today. You can search through your Terminal history using the *everse-i-search* feature by hitting [ctrl]+r which also works on Mac :D

By doing this you should see the following

`(reverse-i-search):`

Start typing and it will find previous commands, if there are multiple matches you can hit [ctrl] + r again to cycle through the results. Hit enter to use the command or the left arrow to select it if you wish to modify the command before running it.

Enjoy!
