G'day guys,

Had YOW! this week in Melbourne and it was amazing as always, big thanks to Lonely Planet for giving me the opportunity to go!

[Found this awesome post](http://alisnic.net/blog/making-your-ruby-fly/) on how to squeeze extra performance out of Ruby. Planning on stepping through the guide with my blog app, will let you know if I run into any problems :)

Also check out [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) for those who haven't heard of it, boot any rails app in under a second.

-Matt
