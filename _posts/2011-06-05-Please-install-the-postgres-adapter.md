title:  "Please install the postgres adapter"
---

I ran into the following problem this evening when starting my *rails server*

	$ rails server
	=> Booting WEBrick
	=> Rails 3.0.4 application starting in development on http://0.0.0.0:3000
	=> Call with -d to detach
	=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server
	Exiting
	/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180/gems/activerecord-3.0.4/lib/active_record/connection_adapters
	/abstract/connection_specification.rb:71:in `rescue in establish_connection':
	Please install the postgres adapter: `gem install activerecord-postgres-adapter`
	(no such file to load -- active_record/connection_adapters/postgres_adapter) (RuntimeError)

I got this error on my laptop so I thought I had some missing dependencies, I ran the gem install command as it suggested but got the following as a response:

	$ gem install activerecord-postgres-adapter
	ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'activerecord-postgres-adapter' (>= 0) in any repository
	ERROR:  Possible alternatives: activerecord-postgis-adapter, activerecord-postgres-copy,
	activerecord-postgres-hstore, activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter, activerecord-dbslayer-adapter

There were a few suggestions on StackOverflow, they suggested installing the postgres gem

	$ gem install pg

However I already had it installed. Ensured I had the latest version and kept looking...

**The solution was** simple really, I needed to change my *database.yml* file.
I had the *adapter* set to *postgres* instead of *postgresql*

Newb mistake I will not be making again.
