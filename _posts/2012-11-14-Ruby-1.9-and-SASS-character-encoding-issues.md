title:  "Ruby 1.9 and SASS character encoding issues"
---

G'day guys,

We have just recently upgraded one of our projects to Ruby 1.9.3 from ree 1.8.7 and had a character encoding issue with a bullet point 'â€¢' in our SASS. 

By adding the following to our code the problem was resolved :)

```
#environment.rb
  Encoding.default_internal = Encoding::UTF_8
  Encoding.default_external = Encoding::UTF_8
	
#my_sass_file.sass
  @charset "UTF-8"
````

-Matt
