title:  "Disc or Disk?"
---

Asked this question yourself? I certainly have. 
I have always used disc when referring to a CD/DVD and disk when referring to a hard drive but I never really knew if that was correct, until today, when I decided to look it up. 

So for those of you interested

**Disk:** A disk refers to magnetic media, such as the disk in your computerâ€™s hard drive or an external hard drive. A disk is always rewritable, unless intentionally locked. You can partition a disk into several smaller volumes, too.

<i>A disk is non-removable.</i>

**Disc:** A disc refers to optical media, such as CD-ROM or a DVD. Some discs are read only, some only allow you to write to them once and some allow you to rewrite to them multiple times.

<i>A disc is removable.</i>

Hope that clears things up, I found the definition [here](http://itsalltech.com/2010/02/15/disk-vs-disc-which-one-is-correct/)
